### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vadim. I work as a web fronted developer. Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://logivad.github.io/test-bothelp/auto)

If you're interested, here's a list of repos I've recently developed while moving through interviews

* Simple Angular speedometer component https://logivad.github.io/test-speedometer/
* More complex Angular bar chart component https://logivad.github.io/test-chart/
* A little Angular application (new email can be created, drafts are saved to browser storage) https://logivad.github.io/test-bothelp/auto
